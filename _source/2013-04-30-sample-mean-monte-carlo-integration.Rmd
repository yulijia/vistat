As discussed [before](sample-mean-monte-carlo-integration.Rmd), in physics and statistics many of
the problems Monte Carlo is used on is under the form of the estimate of an integral unkown in
closed form: $$\hat{\theta}=\int_0^1 f(u)du$$, which can be seen as the evalutaion of $$Ef(u)$$,
where $$u \sim U(0,1)$$. There is another Monte Carlo method named mean-value Monte Carlo method.
Thus proposes to generate $$B$$ numbers uniformly from $$(0,1)$$ and take their average: to
estimate $$\theta$$, $$B=\frac{1}{B}\sum\limits_{b=1}^{B}f(u_b)$$.

In the [**animation** package](http://yihui.name/animation), the function `MC.samplemean()` can be
used to estimate the area under the curve, by computing the average function values. Let's me show
you a quick example, see below.

```{r hit-or-miss-montre-carlo, fig.show='animate', interval=.2}
library(animation)
MC.samplemean(border = NA)$est
```
