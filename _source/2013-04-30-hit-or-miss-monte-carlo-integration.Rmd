## Introduction

I first heard the [Monte Carlo Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) is on a
story of the nuclear weapon project. The Montre Carlo Method was invented in the late 1940s by
Stanislaw Ulam, it was used at Los Alamos for early work relating to the development of the
hydrogen bomb, and became popularized in the fields of physics, physical chemistry, and operations
research. The Montre Carlo Method used for drawing a sample at random from the empirical distribution. A
well-known example is the [Buffon's needle](2013-04-16-buffons-needle.Rmd).

## What is a Monte Carlo Method?

Monte Carlo is often applied in solving definite integral problems in the fields of physics and statistics, 
where many problems can come down to an integral problem with the form: $$\hat{\theta}=\int_0^1 f(u)du$$, which can be seen
as the evalutaion of $$Ef(u)$$, where $$u \sim U(0,1)$$.

The **hit-or-miss** Monte Carlo method generates random points in a bounded graph and counts the
number of 'hits' or points that are in the region whose area we want to evaluate,
$$\hat{\theta}=\frac{\#hits}{\#total}$$. As shown in the [Buffon's
needle](2013-04-16-buffons-needle.Rmd), the $$\pi$$ can be calculated by the sumilation.

Here, I illustrate the hit-or-miss procedure to calculate $$\pi$$ by using the `MC.hitormiss()` function in the [**animation**
package](http://yihui.name/animation). This function generate uniform random numbers and
compute the proportion of points under the curve. Consider a circle inscribed in a unit square.
Given that the circle and the square have a ratio of areas $$P=\pi/4$$, 
$$\pi$$ can be approximated using a Monte Carlo method. We only need to count points that are in the circle, then $$\pi=4P$$.

```{r hit-or-miss-montre-carlo, fig.show='animate', interval=.1}
library(animation)
ani.options(nmax = 200)
f=function (x) sqrt(1-x^2)
P=MC.hitormiss(f,from=0,to=1)$est
Pi=P*4
Pi
```

## Note

This function is for demonstration purpose only; the integral might be very inaccurate when n is
small.

`ani.options('nmax')` specifies the maximum number of trials.
