Statistical graphics are powerful in terms of conveying information. When we see a good graph, we often wonder how it was made (e.g. the [one below](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12675147/559676) via xkcd).

Vistat aims to be a journal-like website, publishing code to reproduce useful or interesting graphs. It is based on Github/Jekyll, and graphs are generated dynamically through the R package [**knitr**](http://yihui.name/knitr), hence reproducibility is guaranteed.
